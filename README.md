## Project Abstract

Cloud applications are increasingly fragmented into aggregations of micro-services that organically cooperate with each other. 
Ensuring consistency between cooperating services raises new challenges: related data is scattered across services; 
services might have heterogenous consistency models; 
cross-service operations cannot rely on the atomicity and isolation properties available when using a single data store. 
Our vision is to propose language-based analysis techniques to validate the application service orchestration and to derive 
the minimum synchronisation among these services. With our approach, developers no longer have to rely on complex and ad-hoc 
reasoning to validate an application. We aim to provide efficient analysis techniques to detect anomalous cross-service interactions. 
Integrating these techniques in the development life-cycle will increase the developer's productivity and improve service quality 
in terms of efficiency, availability and correctness.

## Prototypes and Software
* [VeryFx](https://zenodo.org/record/7719049) Specialized programming language for building RDTs with automated proof capabilities. VeriFx lets programmers implement RDTs atop functional collections and express correctness properties that are verified automatically. Verified RDTs can be transpiled to mainstream languages (currently Scala and JavaScript). VeriFx provides libraries for implementing and verifying Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) and Operational Transformation (OT) functions. These libraries implement the general execution model of those approaches and define their correctness properties.
* [ECROS](https://zenodo.org/record/5897135) Framework supporting replicated datatypes to be derived from sequential data types, based on a distributed specification that declares the application semantics by means of invariants over the replicated state. Includes Ordana analysis tool, supporting middleware, and datatypes portfolio.
* [PETIT](https://bitbucket.org/acmribeiro/petit-v3) Black-box testing tool that fully automates the microservice testing process when the source code is unavailable, and the only information accessible is the OAS document, written in JSON and properly extended with APOSTL contracts, automatically generated by the APOSTLGen tool. These contracts define the state invariants, pre- and post-conditions written at the cost of GET operations.
* [CEC](https://github.com/LightKone/CEC) Tool, based on the CISE theory, designed to help programmers develop weakly consistent application.
